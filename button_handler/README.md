# Button Handler

This is a blueprint to let you set up any actions, bound to a simple button

It's mainly intended for a 2-button device like an IKEA RODRET or SOMRIG, but can be used with single button devices, or even more buttons, however it's two buttons per automation.
It's probably not as genric as I hope, but meh. It works for my rodret

It's heavily inspired by [mcflexus shortcut button blueprint](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zha-ikea-tradfri-shortcut-button/261936) and [damrus control anything blueprint](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ikea-rodret-dimmer-somrig-remotes-zha-z2m-control-anything/590081)
Honestly, I may end up just using damrus blueprint. We'll see.
Mine does have the benefit of exposing the release event... because I implement nothing. You do that in the automation ðŸ˜…
